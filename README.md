# SAP-ERP-Fraud-Data
This repository provides additional information and data on the paper "Analyzing Data Sets for ML-driven Fraud Detection in SAP Systems" by Schnepf et al.

The three data sets (BKPF-BSEG, CDHDR-CDPOS, Trace) contain synthetic data. The origin of the data sets are business processes and frauds that are executed using SAP IDES, which is a well-established model company used for training, teaching, demonstration, and evaluation. In the IDES client, realistic and practice-relevant business processes and frauds are executed. The thereby created records are extracted and then synthetically multiplied with the help of Python scripts.
